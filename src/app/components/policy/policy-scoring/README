### Policy Scoring

This applies 'competitive scoring' directly to legislative policy.

Allows for assertions of competitive scoring to be applied to segments of text in order to
score the overall performance of the policy, in respect to specific contextualized understandings.

Contributive and Voting records on the policies and historical performance on behalf of policies
from politicians, businesses, non-profits, and in some cases individuals, can be accounted for.
