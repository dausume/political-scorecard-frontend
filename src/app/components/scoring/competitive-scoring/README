### Competitive Scoring

Competitive Scoring is an analysis method using basic linear algebra to leverage different variables against one another
in order to contextualize worldviews.

'Worldview Ballots' can be used to have people vote on terms in a particular scoring context, and be used to derive a
democratically determined score either per-consensus or per-group.
